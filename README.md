# objectives

1) TOP 5 COMMODITIES EXPORTED
Using the export dataset , I have found the top 5 most exported commodities throughout the world
from india.
India exports and imports various items to and from various countries in the world . Knowing the top 5
exported items would give us an idea about the most valued resources of India that other countries
import from india.
2) TOP 5 COMMODITIES IMPORTED
Using the import dataset , I have found the top 5 most imported commodities throughout the world to
India.
India exports and imports various items to and from various countries in the world . Knowing the top 5
exported items would give us an idea about the most needed resources for India that it imports from
other countries.
3) TRADE DEFICIT - YEAR WISE
Using the export and import dataset , I have found the trade deficit of each year from 2010 to 2018 A
trade deficit is an amount by which the cost of a country's imports exceeds its exports. It's one way of
measuring international trade, and it's also called a negative balance of trade. You can calculate a trade
deficit by subtracting the total value of a country's exports from the total value of its imports.
4) TRADE DEFICIT - COUNTRY WISE
Using the export and import dataset , I have found the trade deficit for each country throughout the
world. A trade deficit is an amount by which the cost of a country's imports exceeds its exports. It's one
way of measuring international trade, and it's also called a negative balance of trade. You can calculate
a trade deficit by subtracting the total value of a country's exports from the total value of its imports.5) TOP CHINA IMPORTED COMMODITIES
After the USA, China is the second largest exporting country to India. China is the source of around
14% of total Indian imports. Among the various products that India imports from China I have found
out the top 5 commodities that are imported to India from China.
With the current ban on “Made in China” products , it would be a good analysis to know the top
products that India depends on China for.
6) USA- INDIA TRADE
Trade between the United States and India has grown steadily ever since India’s economy began to
take off.
India is now the United States’ eighth-largest trading partner in goods and services and is among the
world’s largest economies.
We have observed the import and export between India and USA and found out the deficit and total
import and total export between the 2 countries over the emerging years of 2010 to 2018.
7) TOP TRADING COUNTRIES
Using the export and import data set , we have found the top 10 countries which have maximum
imports and top 10 countries with maximum exports. I have even found the top countries’ quantity of
commodities imported and exported.
8) IMPORT TRADE BY COMMODITY
Using the import dataset , we have found the commodities trade, that is the amount that each
commodity contributes to the overall trade of India . For each commodity , I have found its amount
summing all the countries that export that particular commodity to india.➢ These are all the objectives that i have found and analysed in this project , and many more can be
found out through the import and export data sets.
